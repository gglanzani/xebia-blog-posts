subtitle: Writing your first Go app with ChatGPT
title: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love LLMs
---

In the sea of AI, there's a new threat on the horizon: Large Language Models (LLMs) and products built upon them, like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. Are they a tsunami about to swipe us away or a giant wave we must learn to ride?

### Summary

To investigate, I started with a concrete itch I had to scratch: sending a reminder to inform our customers, in bulk, by SMS. With ChatGPT, I created an application in a new programming language, Go, in minutes instead of days. I'll walk through how I did that and what it was like, and I'll close by reflecting on how, for programmers trapped doing the same things repeatedly, with minimal variations, LLMs might turn into a frightening tsunami. However, for experienced programmers, LLMs are an incredible wave to ride: you go higher and faster if you know your moves, and that's a lot of fun. 

Since the launch of GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, some people have been saying programmers will disappear as we know them today. In contrast, others said that programmers will be fine as long as the tools just spit out a statistically probably answer without understanding what you ask. Nowadays, I don't code much, making it hard to have an opinion based on first-hand experience.

This changed last week. Some customers asked us to be reminded of an upcoming training and we wanted to send an SMS instead of an email. As we didn't have any system in place for this, a colleague asked me what to do. I knew was about messaging platforms providing APIs to send SMS, so I told him I would build one for him. Selecting a platform was easy: I know MessageBird offers this service, is close to our Amsterdam office, and they are currently facing [headwinds]. That's the equivalent of a farmers market for an API, I thought, so I created an account.

MessageBird offers Python bindings to send SMSs with a simple API:

```python
client = messagebird.Client(ACCESS_KEY)
message = client.message_create(
  sender,
  receiver,
  message_text
)
```

Coding an app around it should be quick, as I'm still well versed in Python.

But then it dawned on me: the next time a colleague needs to send SMS in bulk, I'll have to do it for them as getting a working Python environment is hard if you're not technical. What could I do to avoid being a bottleneck? Go, a language designed at Google, allows running code without installing anything on anyone's computer, Mac, Windows, or Linux. And MessageBird provides a Go API! The only issue: I've never programmed in Go!

### AI-enhanced development

However, I read a [post] from the co-founder of Django on how he became more ambitious with his projects thanks to AI-enhanced development. I had to try, so I started with MessageBird Go API documentation:

```golang
client := messagebird.New("YOUR_ACCESS_KEY")
message, err := sms.Create(
  client,
  sender,
  []string{receiver},
  message_text
)
```

The code is similar to the Python's snippet, with some puzzling syntax such as `[]string{receiver}` and that `err` lying around. I decided to give it a Go!

### Human-crafted architecture

First of all, how should the program be structured? I didn't bother asking ChatGPT, as just explaining what I had in mind was probably longer than just doing it (this is an area where humans are maybe still ahead [add relevant Twitter]). First, I need to create the `client` and pass it the access key. Then I need to read the csv file with the records, split the record by name and phone number, and, for each record, send an SMS. I also thought that customizing the message using the first name was a nice touch.

| name   | phone |
|--------|-------|
| John   | 12345 |
| Mary   | 54321 |

The access key, though, it's a secret, so I don't want to write it directly in the code. How should I approach it?

### AI-enhanced coding

> Q: What's the proper way to pass secrets to a Golang program?

> A: Using environment variables is The proper way to pass secrets, such as API keys or sensitive configuration data, to a Golang program. 

The code suggestion from ChatGPT is:

```golang
// GENERATED BY CHATGPT, EXCLUDING THIS COMMENT
package main  
  
import (  
    "fmt"  
    "os"  
)  
  
func main() {  
    secretKey := os.Getenv("MY_SECRET_KEY")  
    if secretKey == "" {  
        fmt.Println("MY_SECRET_KEY environment variable is not set")  
        os.Exit(1)  
    }  
  
    fmt.Println("My secret key is:", secretKey)  
}  
```

Great! Now I can use the info from the MessageBird docs to create the client with the `secretKey`. Next up is reading a csv file and looping over each row:

> Q: How do I read a csv file in go, and then loop over each record?

```golang
// GENERATED BY CHATGPT, EXCLUDING THIS COMMENT
package main  
  
import (  
	"encoding/csv"  
	"fmt"  
	"log"  
	"os"  
)  
  
func main() {  
	// Open the CSV file  
	file, err := os.Open("data.csv")  
	if err != nil {  
		log.Fatal("Error opening the file:", err)  
	}  
	defer file.Close()  
  
	// Create a new CSV reader  
	reader := csv.NewReader(file)  
  
	// Read the header line (if present)  
	header, err := reader.Read()  
	if err != nil {  
		log.Fatal("Error reading the header:", err)  
	}  
	fmt.Println("Header:", header)  
  
	// Loop over the records  
	for {  
		record, err := reader.Read()  
		if err != nil {  
			break  
		}  
		fmt.Println("Record:", record)  
	}  
```

That's great, but I need to access individual fields in the record. 

> Q: How do I split a record, coming out of reader.Read() in go, so that I can do something with each field?

A long answer came out, with the proper answer buried in the code but not exactly what I asked

> A: When you read a record using reader.Read() from the encoding/csv package in Go, it returns a slice of strings
> 
```golang
// GENERATED BY CHATGPT, EXCLUDING THIS COMMENT
// stuff omitted for brevity
for {  
  record, err := reader.Read()  
  if err != nil {  
    break  
  }  
  // Process each field in the record  
  for i, field := range record {  
    fmt.Printf("Field %d (%s): %s\n", i, header[i], field)  
  }  
  fmt.Println("----")  
	}  
```

Ah, `header[i]` is how you do it. Great! Now I have all the ingredients, I just need to create a function that takes name, phone, a MessageBird client, a sender and sends the SMS!

> Q: How do I create a function in go?

```golang
// GENERATED BY CHATGPT, EXCLUDING THIS COMMENT
func add(a int, b int) int {  
	sum := a + b  
	return sum  
}
```

OK, it seems easy. Now my turn to code and write it

```golang
func sendMessage(client, text str, sender str, recipient str, name str) {
   	msg, err := sms.Create(
		client,
		sender,
		[]string{recipient},
		text,
		nil,
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	}
}
```

OK, almost there. This code has one bug and one problem:

1. Bug: `client` has no type in the function signature
2. I want to interpolate the `name` variable into the `text` variable to personalize the message

> Q: How do I find out the type of a go variable?

ChatGPT replied: `fmt.Printf("Type of var1 (%v) is: %T\n", var1, var1)`. Upon running the snippet, I got `*messagebird.Client`. Later, after I set up [NeoVim] with the Go Language Server protocol ([LSP]), the editor would suggest that `client` is indeed of `*messagebird.Client` type while instantiating it. This is much more convenient than running programs just to get the type of variables.

> Q: How do I do string interpolation in go?

The long answer contained the info I needed: `message := fmt.Sprintf("%s is %d years old and lives in %s.", name, age, city)`. So my code to send the SMS is now

```golang
func sendMessage(client *messageBird.Client, text str, sender str, recipient str, name str) {
  msg, err := sms.Create(
    client,
    sender,
    []string{recipient},
    fmt.Sprintf(text, name)  // text should have a single %s where the `name` should be!!!!
  )
  if err != nil {
  log.Println(err)
 }
}
```

### Putting it all together

I assembled the puzzle with all the pieces from ChatGPT and the MessageBird's documentation:

```golang
package main

import (
	"encoding/csv"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	messagebird "github.com/messagebird/go-rest-api"
	"github.com/messagebird/go-rest-api/sms"
)

func sendMessage(client *messagebird.Client, text string, sender string, recipient string, name string) {
	msg, err := sms.Create(
		client,
		sender,
		[]string{recipient},
		fmt.Sprintf(text, name), // text should have a single %s where the `name` should be!!!!
		nil,
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	}
	log.Println(msg)
}

func main() {
	secretKey := os.Getenv("MESSAGE_BIRD_API")
	if secretKey == "" {
		fmt.Println("MESSAGE_BIRD_API environment variable is not set")
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	client := messagebird.New(secretKey)

	// Open the CSV file
	file, err := os.Open("data.csv")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Error opening the file:", err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Create a new CSV reader
	reader := csv.NewReader(file)

	// Loop over the records
	for {
		record, err := reader.Read()
		if err != nil {
			break
		}
		sendMessage(client, "Hey %s", "Xebia", record[1], record[0]) // assuming the csv file has the format `name, phone`
	}
}
```

This is all there is to it. Time to run it?

> Q: How do I run a go program?

> A: `go run main.go`

Well, that didn't work. My console complained about a missing `go.mod` file.

> Q: How to I create the go.mod file in a go project?

The answer was `go mod init example.com/myproject`. Afterward, I got some errors about missing modules, but Go was so kind to tell me how to fix them

```
go get github.com/messagebird/go-rest-api/
go get github.com/messagebird/go-rest-api/sms
```

Having a working project is terrific because I can start adding new functionality one piece at a time afterward. Since then, I've added configuration management, schema flexibility, and templating. In the spirit of open source, I've put the repository on [GitHub] for everyone's benefit. I still have a couple of TODOs (adding extra documentation and tests), and I want to leverage Copilot to tackle them. More on a future post.

### Looking forward

The speed at which I could get working code in a new language was astonishing, and I think this will have two main consequences. First, if all your coding is small repetitive pieces—rewriting a SQL script from one SQL dialect to another, documentation, creating simple APIs on top of databases—learn to master LLMs prompting, or someone else will take your place. There is simply no way ChatGPT, or an LLM fine-tuned to this task, can't figure out what you're doing with minimal oversight. Second, if you're a seasoned programmer starting in a new area, LLMs are fun. You can do high-level thinking, let LLMs handle time-consuming, simple problems, check their output— as, at the moment, they do not **understand** what you're telling them— and then assemble the pieces.

SHOULD I WRITE THIS? You might ask why I split programmers into two groups. FILL IN.

If you're looking for help to get started, we just launched a training [program] to help you leverage LLMs to be more effective while coding. I'll be there too, so I can learn from the best what I'm still missing to ride this wave even higher and faster.
